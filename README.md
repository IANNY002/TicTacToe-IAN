TIC TAC TOE GAME
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic game using React and Framer Motion for animations.

COMPROMISES MADE
While developing this project within a limited timeframe, I made a few compromises to prioritize certain features and deliver a functional game:

Basic Styling: The focus of this project was primarily on functionality and game mechanics. As a result, the overall styling and visual design of the game may be minimalistic.

Single Device Play: The game is designed for single-device play, meaning that two players would take turns on the same device. Multiplayer functionality over different devices is not implemented.

Limited Testing: While the core functionality of the game has been tested, extensive testing and edge cases handling might not be fully covered due to time constraints.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Given more time, there are several areas I would focus on to enhance the project:

Responsive Design: Improve the game's responsiveness and adaptability for different screen sizes and devices, allowing for a better user experience on various platforms.

Advanced AI: Implement a more sophisticated AI opponent with varying levels of difficulty. This could involve algorithms like the Minimax algorithm to make the AI more challenging and engaging to play against.

Multiplayer: Add support for multiplayer functionality, enabling players to compete against each other over different devices or online.

Customization: Allow players to customize their game experience, such as choosing different themes, board sizes, or game modes.

Animations: Enhance the animations and transitions throughout the game to create a more polished and visually appealing experience.

Accessibility: Improve accessibility features to ensure that the game is usable by a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.

Unit Testing: Implement comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and robustness of the codebase.
